# NLP Project 24 Hours of LeMans

# This project focuses on developing an NLP pipeline to extract key race events from unstructured text data such as    live commentary, driver/team reports, etc. related to the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race.
  The goal is to automatically identify and summarise important events (e.g, pit stops, crashes, overtakes, weather    changes) to help motorsport analysts and fans understand race dynamics.


# PROBLEM STATEMENT 
  Manual analysis of motorsport commentary is time consuming and error prone due to the large volume of unstructured   text generated during the race. Automating event detection using NLP will improve real time race insights, speed     up analysis, and support data-driven decisions.


# Dataset 
  Source & Pre-processing

# Methodology
  Data Pre-processing & Model fine tuning

# Research -> Data collection -> Data Processing -> Model Selection -> Event extraction + Summary 
  (need to focus on evaluation strategy)


# Expected Outcome
  Fine-tuned transformer model capable of detecting race events in free-text commentary, 
  Simple structured output summarizing race highlights, 
  Evaluation showing clear performance improvement over baseline rule-based approach.
